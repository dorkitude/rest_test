Hey!  This should be pretty easy to use.

Define your API and test cases in rest_test/test_setup.py

Currently only supports JSON responses.
Currently only supports one-deep REST resources of the "collection" type.


I'll be adding nesting and the "member" type as soon as I have need in my own projects :)
