Hey!  This should be pretty easy to use.

-Define your API and test cases in rest_test/test_setup.py
-Then use 'python run.py' to see the results!


Currently only supports JSON responses.
Currently only supports one-deep REST resources of the "collection" type.
Currently does *not* support 'comparator' assertions -- only 'type' assertions work right now.


I'll be adding nesting and the "member" type as soon as I have need in my own projects :)
